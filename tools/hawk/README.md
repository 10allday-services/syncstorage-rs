# Make a Hawk compatible Auth header

The best way to install this is probably to set up a python virtual
env.

`python3 -m venv venv && venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt`

this will create a python virtual environment in the `/venv` directory.

*Note* You may need to install `python3-venv` for the above to work.

Use `-h` for help.
